# Markbook Assignment
The goal is to review certain Python concepts as well as pick up some new ones along the way. The assignment will be done in scrum groups of approx. 3 people.

## Topics to be included
The program will include the following topics:
- Looping
- Lists
  - Insert and delete
- Dictionaries
- File read/write
- Functions
- Test suite using `pytest`


## Setup
### Accept GitHub Classroom Assignment
Follow the github classroom link. Join your appropriate team.

### Edit in Replit
- **Important**: First make sure you are logged into replit.
- On your team's repo, click the logo "Work in replit".
- When you hit run the first time, it will install `pytest`. The terminal to the side is actually a terminal and not a python shell.
- Type `pytest` in the terminal to run the tests.
- Work on the assignment in Replit.
- Multiplayer: Optionally, you can share your replit window with your group members and code at the same time.

### Test it out
- In the terminal, run `pytest` and ensure it says it ran two tests.

### Make some change
Have each person on the team make a change and push it to GitHub.
